    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Place carrots into a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat
        and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, but
        reserve cooking liquid. Transfer carrots to a blender container. Cover and blend
        until smooth, adding reserved liquid, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed. You
        should get 1 cup of carrot puree. Chill until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>In a small bowl combine graham cracher crumbs, 1/2 cup toasted
        coconut, butter, 2 tablespoons brown sugar and salt. Press very firmly into the
        bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Chill until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>Beat whipping cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until completely
        smooth and creamy, scraping the bowl as needed.
      </li>
      <li>Add 1 cup carrot puree, powdered sugar, and remaining 4 tablespoons brown
        sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until well combined, scraping the bowl as
        needed. Add the vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and salt and beat until
        combined and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Slowly fold in whipped cream with a spatula until just combined, careful to not
        deflate the whipped cream.
      </li>
      <li>Pour filling into the prepared crust, spreading evenly.</li>
      <li>Cover and chill overnight. Serve topped with additional whipped cream,
        candied pecans and remaining toasted coconut.
      </li>
    </ol>
