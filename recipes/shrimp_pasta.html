    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling
        water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season
        shrimp with salt and pepper; add to the pan and cook 30 seconds per side.
        Remove to plate.
      </li>
      <li>Add shallots to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
        fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, lemon zest, and 1/2 of the lemon
        juice; heat for 2 minutes. Reserve remaining lemon juice for another use.
      </li>
      <li>Add cream and bring to a simmer. Return shrimp to the skillet and cook until
        heated through and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add basil.
      </li>
      <li>Drain spaghetti, reserving 1/4 to 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
      <li>Add spaghetti to the skillet. Add pasta water as needed and pepper flakes; toss
        to coat. Season with pepper if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
