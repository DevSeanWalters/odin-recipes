# odin-recipes

This project will consist of an HTML only site
wherein I will create a few pages of recipes copied
from online resources.

Each recipe will have a picture of the dish, the
ingredients needed, and the cooking directions.

They will each have different sized heading tags where
needed and both unordered and ordered lists.
